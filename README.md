**Code Chef : The Man code**

For maximum number of urinals get used if persons uses odd numbered urinals i.e. from 1 to n if n is odd and 1 to n-1 if n is even . 

And for minimum number of urinals get used if a person captures 3 urinals at a time i.e. in the middle of 3 urinals 

for example if there are N=6 urinals and person uses urinals at 2nd (capturing 1,2,3) and another uses urinal at 5th (capturing 4,5,6) and no other person can get between them too.

So, maximum number of urinals used in this case if 3 and minimum number of urinals used is 2 . Hope ,it helps.
